Defender.java:
Defender.java is not used anywhere. This class should be deleted.

Action.java:
Variable naming “attribute[4]” in method execute() is ambiguous.
getAttackRes method is not necessarily to be an abstract function as it is only used in Attack.java. It can be Attack’s own function.
getLow and getHigh are redundant in finding the lowest and highest level unit.

Attack.java
The field is better be initialized in constructor.
It’s better to give a concrete meaning for each attribute. Try to avoid naming like “attribute[4]”.

Move.java
getAttackRes() is a redundant class.
